# mulearn-mac-campus-chapter-website

Repository to hold source code for the website of our mulearn campus chapter at Mar Augusthinose college Ramapuram. This is the first version of mulearn mac campus chapter website, which was just a leaderboard to the tasks we gave to our newly onboarded students. To view this version `fork this repo with all branches` -> `change to v1.0 branch` -> `open repository folder in vscode` -> `install live server extension` -> `open index.html` -> `click on go live`

In general just run index.html file after launching a web server with this branch v1.0 as source folder.
